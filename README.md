#####"Den Pudding an die Wand Nageln" - Nailing Pudding to the Wall

The rather harsh sounding and apparently technologically restrictive rules of the Dogma 95 manifesto on filmmaking assert that the movie is no illusion and cinema in not individual. These two main strings are rethought in this thesis as the influences of interfaces and presentation on the content of media artworks, the interaction and technology that is taking over the content of media artworks, and finally the dilemma of the artist as a single entity or working in collaboration. The Dogma 95 further states “The movie was dead and called for resurrection” and so the “DOGMA 95 is a rescue action!”. Is media art in need of rescue? An experiment in form of a manifesto was performed, entitled the Schema-D or the [Jelloment], derived from the Dogma 95.

Jelloment is the seemingly impossible. The German saying, “Den Pudding an die Wand nageln”, translates to "Nailing pudding to the wall". It is a saying that describes doing something that seems impossible.

##### The following manifesto is up for discussion, improvement, alteration...

This jiggly framework is breaking out of the Schema-F and creating theSchema-D or the [Jelloment]Media art is need of rescue! Creating a new name will not make a difference but just transfer the problems. The problems have to be addressed and media art refined.CONSTRAINTS WILL FORGE CREATIVITY and experimentationAs the technologies design predicts how the user is interacting with the work, it takes control over the meaning as it took control over the artist in the creation of the work and aestheticsWE HAVE TO FREE OURSELVES FROM PRESETS GIVEN BY TECHNOLOGY, NO COMPROMISES IN FAVOR OF TECHNOLOGY and disadvantages TOWARDS CONTENT

<br />

01. The interface must not be the artwork. It must functionally, aestheticallyand visually reflect the content opposed to the function.02. Works have to be exhibited as the actual piece and not as documentation (If there is an experience to make, the visitor must beable to make this experience.)03. Technology and technical devices must be older than 3 years if they are not explored within two weeks of their release.04. NO superficial, forced or unnecessary interaction; The interaction has to be in context to the content. NO Screen to control the artworks05. Games and instructions are not acceptable.06. Established interface devices cannot be used for their original purpose. A.k.a. hack them!07. Projections and screens must not use the given format of the device.08. Use raw images or produce the images live e.g. live coding or live footage; Non-live video footage must apply to the Dogma 95 rules.09. Sounds can be amplified but must be live. Samples and recordings must not be used. Computed or generated sounds must be an action of a live event.10. The Artist Is A Single Entity! Collaboration Is A Myth; Let’s Collaborate.
