"Den Pudding an die Wand Nageln" - Nailing Pudding to the Wall

The rather harsh sounding and apparently technologically restrictive rules of the Dogma 95 manifesto on filmmaking assert that the movie is no illusion and cinema in not individual. These two main strings are rethought in this thesis as the influences of interfaces and presentation on the content of media artworks, the interaction and technology that is taking over the content of media artworks, and finally the dilemma of the artist as a single entity or working in collaboration. The Dogma 95 further states “The movie was dead and called for resurrection” and so the “DOGMA 95 is a rescue action!”. Is media art in need of rescue? An experiment in form of a manifesto was performed, entitled the Schema-D or the [Jelloment], derived from the Dogma 95.

Jelloment is the seemingly impossible. The German saying, “Den Pudding an die Wand nageln”, translates to "Nailing pudding to the wall". It is a saying that describes doing something that seems impossible.
